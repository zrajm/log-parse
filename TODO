  * BUGFIX:

        kredgrep -P -H store_show <2007->-*/audit.log |kredgrep -p 'eid[^0-9]*\b326\b'

    gives

        kredgrep: Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at /usr/local/bin/kredgrep line 581.
        kredgrep: Can't open file `-': Interrupted system call

    Maybe kredgrep's stdout is closed between reading files, given broken input
    to 2nd invocation? Anyways. Needs to be fixed.

  * `bin/kredconvert' results in spurious `Use of uninitialized value in print
    at /usr/local/share/perl/5.8.8/Log/Parse.pm line 279.' messages. It is
    apparently _save_scalar() that is sometimes fed undef instead of real data.
    Where does this come from? And does it result in bad things?

  * `bin/kredgrep' now depends on Term::ReadKey and Term::ANSIColor which are
    not included in the standard Perl distribution -- how should this be
    indicated in the CPAN distribution? -- Right now it's just mentioned in
    INSTALL, should it be put somewhere else, so as to automate installation
    when doing a CPAN install?

  * add tests for `bin/kredgrep' and `bin/kredconvert'

  * (optionally) split on list of regexes (if it is faster with REGEX1 ||
    REGEX2, than just plain /(REGEX1|REGEX2)/

  * .gz, .lzma support for infiles

  * Proper unit test for close() implicit when open()ing new file

  * Should warn a file was opened/read without finding any matching
    `entry_regex':es

  * `mkdir -p' is called using system, could this be done using only Perl-native
    code?

  * could read() be made more efficient? (The chunked reading implemented now is
    quite a lot faster than the most obvious readline() approach.)

  * Processing of standard input:

    o Add a whole lot of unit tests on stdin!

    o Proper error messages (esp. if user tries to use `resume_dir' function. --
      Is there any situation where this makes sense on standard input? Should we
      read forward to resume point, instead of seeking, or will this never be
      used? [I'm inclined to believe this will never be used.])

    o When using kredgrep on non-existing file, I get bad error message.

      $ kredgrep 'hej' 2008-01/estore.
      kredgrep: Use of uninitialized value in addition (+) at /usr/local/bin/kredgrep line 568.
      kredgrep: Cannot open file `2008-01/estore.': No such file or directory
