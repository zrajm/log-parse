TODO:

  * Proper test for close() implicit when open()ing new file
  * Should warn a file was opened/read without finding any matching
    "entry_regex"es
  * "mkdir -p" is called using system, could this be done with only
    Perl code?
  * could read() be made more efficient? (The chunked reading
    implemented now is quite a lot faster than the most obvious
    readline() approach.)
  * Processing of standard input:
    o Add a whole lot of unit tests on stdin!
    o Proper error messages (esp. if user tries to use "resume_dir"
      function. -- Is there any situation where this makes sense on
      standard input? Should we read forward to resume point, instead
      of seeking, or will this never be used? [I'm inclined to believe
      this will never be used.])
