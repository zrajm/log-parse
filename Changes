0.03  Thu Jan 21 12:20:57 2008
	- open() now returns offset at which reading will start

0.04  Thu Feb 3 11:28:04 2008
	- renamed "contrib" directory "bin"
        - added unit tests for open() return values
        - started re-working of "kredgrep"

        - "kredgrep" is now fully functional
        - open() no longer carps if sysopen() fails, but sets $! and return
          whatever CORE::sysopen() returned so as to emulate perl-native open()
          better
        - open() returns the magical "0 but true" if read()ing will start at
          beginning of file
        - Basic reading from STDIN now working (no resume/seeking as of yet, so
          STDIN reading always start at beginning)
        - close() no longer carps on error, but sets $! and return whatever
          CORE::close() returned so as to emulate perl-native closed() better
        - change command to read STDIN from open('') to the (among Unices) more
          common open('-') (to open a file literally called `-' one must now use
          `./-' or specify the full path)
	- added position()

[[eof]]
