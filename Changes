Revision history for Perl extension Log::Parse.

0.01  Thu Jan 17 03:49:25 CET 2008
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options X -n Log::Parse
	- imported module code + unit tests from source written earlier. 1st
          release.

0.02  Thu Jan 17 10:48:00 CET 2008
	- added contrib/kredconvert
	- added some FIXMEs

0.03  Thu Jan 21 12:20:57 CET 2008
	- open() now returns offset at which reading will start

0.04  Thu Feb 3 11:28:04 CET 2008
	- renamed "contrib" directory "bin"
        - added unit tests for open() return values
        - started re-working of "kredgrep"
        - "kredgrep" is now fully functional
        - open() no longer carps if sysopen() fails, but sets $! and return
          whatever CORE::sysopen() returned so as to emulate perl-native open()
          better
        - open() returns the magical "0 but true" if read()ing will start at
          beginning of file
        - Basic reading from STDIN now working (no resume/seeking as of yet, so
          STDIN reading always start at beginning)
        - close() no longer carps on error, but sets $! and return whatever
          CORE::close() returned so as to emulate perl-native closed() better
        - change command to read STDIN from open('') to the (among Unices) more
          common open('-') (to open a file literally called `-' one must now use
          `./-' or specify the full path)
	- added position()
        - bin/kredconvert: added `--verbose' option
        - bin/kredconvert: changed `entry_regex' to better match some less
          common cases

0.05  Wed Mar 12 13:24:43 CET 2008
        - Makefile.PL: now also installs executable files found in `bin/' on
          `make install'

0.06  Sun Mar 30 21:07:09 CEST 2008
        - Log/Parse.pm: open() behaves more gracefully on error (returns undef
          and sets $! properly); internal _read_into_buffer() also modified to
          accomplish this
	- bin/kredgrep, bin/kredplot, bin/kredresponses: removed error checking
          now implemented into Log/Parse.pm
	- t/Log-Parse.t: added tests for above fact
        - README: removed badly updated version number
        - bin/kredresponses: added new tool to process kredlogs
